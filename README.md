This is repository is a demonstration of GPU interoperability. 

So far, only CUDA and OpenACC with MPI are functioning, but 
OpenMP4 is being added in Testing. 

CUDA+OpenACC: contains the interoperable GPU languages + MPI
Hybrid: contains all the GPU languages, but they are not interoperable

testing: OpenACC+OpenMP4 with cmake
